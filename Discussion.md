Solution 
The provided code is a Node.js script designed to extract log entries from a specified log file for a given date and save them to an output file. The script performs the following key tasks:

Input Validation: It checks if the log file exists and if the correct number of command-line arguments are provided.
Output Directory Creation: It ensures that the output directory exists, creating it if necessary.
Log Extraction: It reads the log file line-by-line, checks if each line starts with the target date, and writes matching lines to the output file.
Logging: It logs the progress and results of the extraction process to the console.
The solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Node.js's built-in fs and readline modules to handle file operations and stream processing.
Steps to Run
Install Node.js: Ensure that Node.js is installed on your system. You can download it from nodejs.org.

Prepare the Log File: Ensure you have a log file with entries formatted such that each line starts with a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

Save the Script: Save the provided script to a file named extract_log_solution.js.

Open Terminal: Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to Script Directory: Change the directory to where the script is saved. For example:
Run the Script: Execute the script with the log file path and target date as arguments. For example:
node extract_log_solution.js logs_2024.log 2025-02-02
Check Output: The script will create an output directory (if it doesn't already exist) and save the extracted logs to a file named output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt within this directory. The console will display messages indicating the progress and completion of the extraction process.

By following these steps, you can successfully run the script and extract log entries for a specified date.
